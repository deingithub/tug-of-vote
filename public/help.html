      This is a tool for simple-to-use collaborative decision-making. If you just got a link asking you to vote in a poll, you can choose a unused name, select whether or not you like the proposal (or whether you're apathetic), optionally add a reason for your stance and send the entire thing off. Because you might change your mind later, you'll also need to set a password. Once you use a name, you can only change the vote associated to that name if you have the password.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to create a poll, go to <a href="/new">this page</a> and fill in your proposal. You'll be automagically redirected to your new admin view. Here you can add your own vote and end voting whenever you want to. Ending a poll is irreversible.<br>
      Further down, in the "Meta" field, you'll see four links. The first one gives access to the admin page. Keep it secret! The second one allows voting on the poll, you can share it to everyone that should be able to vote. The final two ones only allow viewing the poll results, but the last one hides all names from votes and reasons. Everyone can see the all links that are lower-tier than their own, the order being Admin&nbsp;→ Vote&nbsp;→ View&nbsp;→ View (Anonymized).
    </p>
    <p>
      Lists allow you to group polls together. You can create a new list <a href="/new_list">here</a>. Once you fill in a title and a description for it, you get redirected to a page where you can add links to polls or other lists to your list.
      In the "Meta" panel, you'll find two links. The first one is for you and should be kept secret, as it allows access to this admin panel. The other one allows viewing the list, which also means access to all links in it. Share this link extremely carefully!
      You can add polls to your list either by copying any link to a poll into the list manually using the "append to list" form under "Admin" or by just creating a new poll directly linked to the list using the "Add a new poll to this list" link in the list area.
      This will redirect you to the new poll form but automatically add the vote link for your new poll into your list.
