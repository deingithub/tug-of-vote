    <p>
      This is a tool for simple-to-use collaborative decision-making. If you just got a link asking you to vote in a poll, you can choose a unused name, select whether or not you like the proposal (or whether you're apathetic), optionally add a reason for your stance and send the entire thing off. Because you might change your mind later, you'll also need to set a password. Once you use a name, you can only change the vote associated to that name if you have the password.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to create a poll, go to <a href="/new">this page</a> and fill in your proposal. You'll be automagically redirected to your new admin view. Here you can add your own vote and end voting whenever you want to. Ending a poll is irreversible.<br>
      Further down, in the "Meta" field, you'll see four links. The first one gives access to the admin page. Keep it secret! The second one allows voting on the poll, you can share it to everyone that should be able to vote. The final two ones only allow viewing the poll results, but the last one hides all names from votes and reasons. Everyone can see the all links that are lower-tier than their own, the order being Admin&nbsp;→ Vote&nbsp;→ View&nbsp;→ View (Anonymized).
